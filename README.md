# Welcome to Route Generator!

Inspired by my love for running, and my half-marathon training I did during the latter half of 2024, I created a web application that generates running routes based on a few inputs given by a user. I utilized Python, Streamlit, OpenRouteService, and Folium to make this happen.

When running this app, the user can input the address of their location, a desired running distance, and a preferred elevation level to generate some running routes. Displayed on a map, the user can toggle between the generated routes, and get inspired on where to run!
